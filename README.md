# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Decreasing the mortality rate by predicting the possibility of coronary heart disease at an early stage by analyzing a set of medical attributes of an individual and comparing it with a standard dataset.
The main difficulty with heart disease is detecting it at an early stage. There are tools that can forecast heart disease, but they are either expensive or ineffective at calculating the likelihood of heart disease in humans.However, it is not always possible to precisely monitor patients every day, and consulting with a doctor on a patient for 24 hours is not practicable because it would take more intelligence, time, and knowledge.Since there is a lot of data available nowadays, we can use a variety of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to search for hidden patterns. In medical data, the hidden patterns might be used for health diagnosis.
