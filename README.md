# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The main difficulty with heart disease is detecting it at an early stage. There are tools that can forecast heart disease, but they are either expensive or ineffective at calculating the likelihood of heart disease in humans.However, it is not always possible to precisely monitor patients every day, and consulting with a doctor on a patient for 24 hours is not practicable because it would take more intelligence, time, and knowledge.Since there is a lot of data available nowadays, we can use a variety of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to search for hidden patterns. In medical data, the hidden patterns might be used for health diagnosis.

Objective : 
1)	Decreasing the mortality rate by predicting the possibility of coronary heart disease at an early stage by analyzing a set of medical attributes of an individual and comparing it with a standard dataset.
2)	Usually the machines and tools involved in the medical diagnosis are pretty expensive. In such a case these machine learning tools can be a good starting point.
3)	Evaluating the algorithms and projecting the best one for coronary heart disease detection.

Proposed Technology:
The algorithms used to implement this project are:
1)Logistic Regression Algorithm
2)Decision Tree Algorithm
3)Random Forest Algorithm
